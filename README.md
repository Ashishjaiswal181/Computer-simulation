# Computer-simulation

The first simulation conducted was single server single queue model.

The second simulation conducted was Able-Baker queue model which has two servers and single queue model.

The third simulation conducted was the discrete distributions which include Binomial, Negative Binomial and Geometrical distribution.

The forth simulation conducted was the continuous distribution but it also contain a discrete distribution code i.e. Poisson distribution
the discrete distribution includes Uniform distribution, Exponential distribution and Normal distribution.

The next program is the simulation of a 6-sided biased die roll.

# More programs will be added to the repository as the semester proceeds. Thank you!
