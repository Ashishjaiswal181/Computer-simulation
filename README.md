# Computer-simulation

- The first simulation conducted was single server single queue model.

- The second simulation conducted was Able-Baker queue model which has two servers and single queue model.

- The third simulation conducted was the discrete distributions which include Binomial, Negative Binomial and Geometrical distribution.

- The forth simulation conducted was the continuous distribution but it also contain a discrete distribution code i.e. Poisson             distribution the discrete distribution includes Uniform distribution, Exponential distribution and Normal distribution. In the new commit the graph is also added to the code for every distribution using JfreeChart library.

- The fifth simulation is based on Chi-square method of testing a system on how well it produces a random number or is the system biased or unbiased using a example of dice rolling system. 

### More programs will be added to the repository as the semester proceeds. Thank you!
